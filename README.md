# Glyphy

Glyphy is a small utility package that searches
through a list of Unicode glyph names and prints a list 
of glyphs that match the search term, and any REPL shortcuts,
if available. All `glyphy` methods can also return the output
as a `Matrix` if this is preferred.

```julia-term
using Glyphy

julia> glyphy("peacock")

1f99a   🦚       peacock ⌨ \:peacock:
 found one glyph matching "peacock"
``` 

There might be a few:

```julia-term
julia> glyphy("smiling")

0263a   ☺   ✓    white smiling face ⌨ \:relaxed:
0263b   ☻   ✓    black smiling face ⌨ \blacksmiley

```

Here, the check marks indicate that the glyph is available in
the latest release of the JuliaMono font (it doesn't know
which font you're currently using in your terminal).

Glyphy can also look for the glyph with a specific integer
code point. It's usual to type them as hexadecimal integers,
so `0x2055`, `0x1f638`, etc.

```julia-term
julia> glyphy(0x1f638)

1f638   😸       grinning cat face with smiling eyes ⌨ \:smile_cat:
```

You can look for ranges and arrays of values:

```julia-term
julia> glyphy(0x32:0x7f)

00032   2   ✓    digit two
00033   3   ✓    digit three
00034   4   ✓    digit four
00035   5   ✓    digit five
00036   6   ✓    digit six
00037   7   ✓    digit seven
00038   8   ✓    digit eight
00039   9   ✓    digit nine
...
0007b   {   ✓    left curly bracket
0007c   |   ✓    vertical line
0007d   }   ✓    right curly bracket
0007e   ~   ✓    tilde
```

```julia-term
julia> glyphy([0x63, 0x2020, 0x2640])

00063   c   ✓    latin small letter c
02020   †   ✓    dagger ⌨ \dagger
02640   ♀   ✓    female sign ⌨ \female
```

```julia-term
julia> glyphy("^z.*")

0200b   ​         zero width space
0200c   ‌         zero width non-joiner
0200d   ‍         zero width joiner
022ff   ⋿   ✓    z notation bag membership ⌨ \bagmember
02981   ⦁   ✓    z notation spot
02982   ⦂   ✓    z notation type colon
02987   ⦇   ✓    z notation left image bracket
02988   ⦈   ✓    z notation right image bracket
02989   ⦉   ✓    z notation left binding bracket
0298a   ⦊   ✓    z notation right binding bracket
02a1f   ⨟   ✓    z notation schema composition ⌨ \bbsemi
02a20   ⨠   ✓    z notation schema piping
...
```

There are over 30,000 characters to search, so searches
might take a few milliseconds...

### Sources

The current version of Unicode is 17.0, released in September 2025.
The glyph list used by Glyphy is the file `UnicodeData.txt` from
[here](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/), dated 2026-09-01 15:29.

JuliaMono font (https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono) is at version v0.063.

REPL shortcuts are as found in Julia 1.13.

The font fallback mechanism on your computer should be able to find suitable designs for many of the Unicode glyphs, subject to the abilities of your terminal. (More explanations [here](https://www.figma.com/blog/when-fonts-fall/).)

Glyphy is also available as a web service, at [glyphy.info](https://glyphy.info):

```julia
> gd = DataFrame(glyphy(0x1CEC0:0x1CED0, output = :array), :auto)
```
